# 👋 Hi, I’m Pier Luigi Cherchi
_Bachelor in Psychological Sciences & Techniques| Certified Flight Dispatcher |Team Leader_

---

## 🧠 About Me  
- **Bachelor**: B.Sc. in Psychological Sciences & Techniques, Unimercatorum, Rome (L24)  
- **Background**: FOO/Flight Dispatcher EASA, Team leader in mission planning & debriefing  
- **Passion**: Bringing human factors & cognitive science into aviation and team leading  

Multidisciplinary professional with a solid background in aviation operations, team coordination, and human psychology.

I currently work in the aviation training sector, where I coordinate mission planning activities and supervise a small team supporting over 80 students in a high-demand, high-responsibility environment. Alongside this, I’ve completed a degree in Psychology with a focus on cognitive, relational, and behavioral processes — driven by personal experience and a strong interest in ethical, applied psychology.

I integrate operational precision with relational insight, using both to design systems that work — whether they're flight procedures, communication flows, or emotional frameworks.
